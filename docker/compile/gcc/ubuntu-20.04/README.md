IMPORTANT NOTE
--------------

This Docker image is NOT CURRENTLY USED. For Couchbase Server builds
on Ubuntu 20.04, we use the gcc 7.5.0 from the Ubuntu repositories.
This Dockerfile is checked in only in case it proves useful in the
future (in particular the libsanitizer patch for compiling with newer
versions of glibc).
