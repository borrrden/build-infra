Setup Mobile MACOS

Prereq
1. Create a new Mac VM by importing mac ovf from latestbuild.
2. Typically, the mac ovf already has xcode and commandline tools installed.  If not, install it.


Deploy tools via ansible
1. git clone https://github.com/couchbase/build.git
2. cd build/ansible/macosx/couchbase-mobile
3. Download MacOS codesign cert, from lastpass. unzip it to files directory so that it becomes files/Certificates.p12
4. Ensure a copy of the following file in ssh directory
       buildbot_id_dsa
       config
       id_ns-codereview
       id_rsa
       ns-buildbot.rsa
       patch_via_gerrit.ini
5. Ensure a copy of jenkins-appledeveloper.developerprofile in files directory
    info is in team's lastpass database
6. Run the playbook and enter sudo password
    % ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml  --ask-become-pass
   SGW mac uses python 2.x, hence skip python 3.x install
    % ansible-playbook -i inventory playbook.yml  --ask-become-pass
7. Follow and run instructions from the ansible-playbook's post-install output message
