    # Code depends on .NET Framework 4.5.2 (chocolatey package "dotnet4.5.2"),
    # but that package fails to install via Ansible due to silly limitations
    # in WinRM (see also: all the nonsense in install-kb.yml). However, the
    # framework is actually installed by default on Server 2012R2, so there's
    # no need to install it. So we just tell chocolatey to skip dependencies.
