This directory contains an Ansible inventory for the current Linux CV
VMs. These nodes were manually configured into a Docker Swarm. Each node
was manually given the swarm node label "cvtype" with values:

  ubuntu18-small
  ubuntu18-large
  ubuntu16-small
  ubuntu12-small

These labels are used in a Docker stack file to deploy the CV agents on
the corresponding nodes.
